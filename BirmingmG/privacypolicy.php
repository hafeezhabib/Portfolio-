              <p>We ask that you read this privacy notice carefully as it contains important information on who we are, how and why we collect, store, use and share personal information, your rights in relation to your personal information and on how to contact us and supervisory authorities in the event you have a complaint.</p>
              <h2 class="fontfamly">Summary</h2>
              <p>We use your data to provide the BirminghamCityGarage marketplace platform service to you and for the purposes of running our marketplace platform business.</p>
              <p>We delete your data when it is no longer needed for these things.</p>
              <p>Generally, we do not give your information to third parties other than mechanics (if you are looking for auto services) or electricians (if you are looking for electrical installation services) or your customer and potential customers looking for such services, but there are some exceptions where we use external service providers to power our operations – some of these are outside Europe.</p>
              
              <h2 class="fontfamly">Who we are</h2>
              <p>This Privacy Notice is directed to you if you are either someone who works for a business that has enquired about or been contacted about registration as a mechanic or electrician on the platform (referred to as a “Service Provider” in this notice), or someone looking to connect with a Service Provider for the provision of auto services or electrical installation services (referred to as a “customer” in this notice).</p>

              <h3 class="fontfamly">Use of Profiling and Automated Decision Making</h3>
              <p>Our profiling and automated decision making process works as follows:</p>
              <ol>
                <li>Information (including personal information) is processed by third party service providers to assess whether a user or provided credit card is fraudulent. </li>
                <li>When a booking is placed, a third party service provider returns a score indicating to what extent the user’s behaviour suggests fraudulent behaviour. If the score exceeds our internally set threshold, a booking will be held for review before being offered to Service Providers. This review is conducted by a human, and may result in either further evidence of legitimacy being requested, or being rejected entirely without being offered to Service Providers. </li>
                <li>At the point of authorising a payment, a third party service provider will assess the payment authorisation for likely fraud and may automatically block the card. In this case, the Service Provider and our team will be informed that the payment authorisation did not succeed and agree an appropriate action. </li>
              </ol>
              <h3 class="fontfamly">Who we share your personal information with</h3>
              <p>If you are a customer, we will share relevant information about you and your booking (including your name, address, telephone number, vehicle registration number, and the nature of the auto services you require) with Service Providers we consider suitable for your booking.</p>
              <p>We will share personal information with law enforcement or other authorities if required by applicable law.</p>
              <p>We will not share your personal information with any other third party. For marketing and advertising purposes, certain information will also be collected from you by third parties such as advertisers, marketing networks of affiliates using cookies or similar technologies. Information collected this way will never include any personal information that would enable you to be identified in the offline world. Read our cookie policy to learn how you can adjust what information will be shared.</p>
              <p>We will not share your personal information with any other third party.</p>
              <h3 class="fontfamly">How long your personal information will be kept</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>Data about customers: we will keep this for the duration of your relationship with us, then: <ul>

              <p>In the section of this notice which sets out what data we collect and how we use it, we refer to different legal bases for processing. Further details on each of those are set out here.</p>
              <p>Legitimate Interest: means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best service and the best and most secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities by contacting us.</p>
              <p>Performance of Contract: means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a contract between us and you or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.</p>

In that case, your data protection will be covered by the introducing party's Privacy Notice, rather than our own Privacy Notice.</p>
