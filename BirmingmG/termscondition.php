We are therefore not responsible for any inaccuracies in the Mechanic Listing.</div>

For example, he/she may hire labour, order in parts, and research aspects of your car required in order to effectively carry out the relevant repairs, diagnosis and/or inspection. The cancellation provisions in the Auto Service Booking Policies are intended to reflect the value of the Auto Services already provided in advance of the time of cancellation, and therefore the amount of your liability to pay to the Mechanic as a result of the cancellation.</div>

If you fail to either accept or reject that offer within 1 hour of our notifying you of it, you will be deemed to have accepted it.
