              </div>

              <h3 class="policy-heading">How do we protect your information?</h3>

              <p>We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when
                you
                place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information.</p>

              <p>We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via
                Secure
                Socket Layer (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our payment gateway providers database only to be
                accessible by those authorized with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the
                information confidential.</p>

              <p>After a transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.)
                will not be stored on our servers.</p>

              <h3 class="policy-heading">Do we use cookies?</h3>

              <p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer’s hard
                drive
                through your Web browser (if you allow) that enables the sites or service providers systems to recognize
                your browser and capture and remember certain information.</p>

              <p>We use cookies to keep track of advertisements and compile aggregate data about site traffic and site
                interaction so that we can offer better site experiences and tools in the future. We may contract with
                third-party service providers to assist us in better understanding our site visitors. These service
                providers are not permitted to use the information collected on our behalf except to help us conduct and
                improve our business.</p>

              <h3 class="policy-heading">Do we disclose any information to outside parties?</h3>

              <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable
                information.
                This does not include trusted third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our
                business, or servicing you, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may
                also release your information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our
                site policies, or protect ours or others rights, property, or safety. However, non-personally
                identifiable
                visitor information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>

              <h3 class="policy-heading">Third party links</h3>

              <p>Occasionally, at our discretion, we may include or offer third party products or services on our
                website.
                These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no
                responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these linked sites. Nonetheless, we seek
                to
                protect the integrity of our site and welcome any feedback about these sites.</p>


              <h3 class="policy-heading">California Online Privacy Protection Act Compliance</h3>

              <p>Because we value your privacy we have taken the necessary precautions to be in compliance with the
                California Online Privacy Protection Act. We therefore will not distribute your personal information to
                outside parties without your consent.</p>

              <h3 class="policy-heading">Online privacy policy only</h3>

              <p>This online privacy policy applies only to information collected through our website and not to
                information collected offline.</p>

              <h3 class="policy-heading">Terms and Conditions</h3>

              <p>When you use our services, you're agreeing to all the terms and conditions listed on this page.</p>

              <h3 class="policy-heading">Originality of content</h3>

              <p>To ensure you get the best and most original content, we do supply (on request) premium Copyscape
                reports. Copyscape reports check originality against text contained in html webpages that have been
                indexed by search engines, based on Copyscape’s own plagiarism algorithm.</p>

              <p>Any text contained in images, videos or other media, which search engines can't read will be omitted by
                Copyscape.</p>

              <p>Our guarantee of plagiarism free copy, guarantees that the work we do will show up as original on
                Copyscape reports only. The responsibility for more comprehensive and deeper plagiarism checks, than
                Copyscape will fall on you, as we do not cover such services in our standard prices.</p>

              <p>All work submitted upon project completion becomes your property, if it is paid for, and your
                responsibility.</p>


              <h3 class="policy-heading">Use of images</h3>

              <p>We do not claim ownership of any of the images we recommend with any of the orders we are hired for.
                Nor,
                do we claim to transfer rights to any images. The copyright of images are solely owned by the
                photographer
                who took the image.</p>

              <p>When you are recommended an image, you get a link that you may use to stream the image. You can paste
                this link directly into your blog, newsletter, website, or any other online source where you would like
                the image to appear. You may stream the image provided and use it with full confidence.</p>

              <p>In certain cases, we may provide clients links to recommended images that they may purchase before
                using
                from a third-party. The responsibility to purchase the image before use is the responsibility of the
                client.</p>


              <h3 class="policy-heading">Publication of images</h3>

              <p>Depending on your project requirements, we may recommend images for you to use. Each image submitted
                would be linked to the original source file.</p>

              <p>It is the responsibility of the client and/or webmaster to comply with publishing guidelines of the
                image’s owner. This may require purchase of image and/or attribution. ContentDevelopmentPros will
                recommend images, but ultimately it’s the website owner and/or client’s responsibility to ensure that
                the
                images published don’t infringe any copyrights.</p>

              <h3 class="policy-heading">Limitation of Liability</h3>

              <p>Under no circumstances shall ContentDevelopmentPros or any of its stakeholders be liable for any damage
                (including incidental, special, direct, punitive, exemplary, or consequential damages) which allegedly
                might have resulted from the use of this website or from the services rendered, this includes viruses
                that
                have been purportedly obtained from the website. In no event shall ContentDevelopmentPros share in any
                liability that may result from the inability or ability of the user to use the content or information
                provided by the website.</p>

              <h3 class="policy-heading">No Warranty</h3>

              <p>Under no circumstances will ContentDevelopmentPros or any of its affiliates, advertisers, promoters or
                distribution partners be responsible for any loss or damage, including personal injury or death,
                resulting
                from anyone's use of the Site or the Service, any Content posted on the Site or transmitted to Members,
                or
                any interactions between users of the Site, whether online or offline. The Site and the Service are
                provided "as is". ContentDevelopmentPros does not warrant the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of
                this
                information and materials and expressly disclaims liability for errors or omissions in this information
                and materials. No warranty of any kind, implied, expressed or statutory including but not limited to the
                warranties of non-infringement of third party rights, title, merchantability, fitness for a particular
                purpose and freedom from computer virus, is given in conjunction with the information and materials.</p>

              <p>Without limitation, users are solely responsible for ensuring the accuracy and legality of any content
                ordered.</p>

              <h3 class="policy-heading">Submission of Project Related Documents</h3>

              <p>Clients are encouraged to submit all project-related documents, revisions, and instructions
                electronically via email or through their client dashboard. If that is not possible, pictures of the
                documents (taken with your phone) can be sent through WhatsApp, Google Drive, or any other electronic
                form
                including fax. For documents that require revisions, we encourage clients to send us files with track
                changes on MS Word or Google Docs. As a service provider, we prioritize quality of work and deadlines.
                Receiving revisions electronically makes it easier and quicker for our teams to complete projects
                quickly.
                It takes significantly more time to go through handwritten notes and often times files we receive have
                handwritten sections that are not legible. </p>

              <p>If it is absolutely necessary to send project-related documents via mail, clients must contact us for
                the
                appropriate mailing address and incur Document Processing Charges. We have production team members in
                New
                Jersey, Texas, Illinois, California, and even the UK. Upon request, our team will send you the address
                of
                the office most relevant to your order to reduce the amount of time it takes us to receive the
                documents.
              </p>

              <p>Please note that mailing documents will result in additional charges (Document Processing Charges),
                which
                will be dependent on the number of documents, complexity of the project, and urgency of your project.
                Simple 1 to 2 page documents will be free of charge, whereas, handwritten books or other larger
                documents
                will be charged a processing fee as it will take our production team more time to go through the
                documents. </p>

              <h3 class="policy-heading">Right to Refuse Service</h3>

              <p>As service provider, we reserve the right to refuse certain types of projects. ContentDevelopmentPros
                does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, or sexual orientation – however, we
                will not work on any of the following types of projects:</p>

              <ul class="sailent-features">

                <li>Academic assignments</li>

                <li>Academic papers</li>

                <li>Academic reports</li>

                <li>Racially insensitive topics</li>

                <li>Religiously insensitive topics</li>

                <li>Malicious, slanderous, or defamatory content</li>

                <li>Erotic content</li>

                <li>Content that does not align with our ethical values</li>

              </ul>

              <p>A refund will be issued to clients in case we unknowingly accept an order that we can’t work on. Please
                speak with a representative if you would like clarification.</p>

              <h3 class="policy-heading">Changes to our Privacy Policy and Terms</h3>

              <p>If we decide to change our privacy policy or terms, we will post those changes on this page.</p>

              <h3 class="policy-heading">Refund Policy</h3>

              <p>If you request a refund before we start working on your project, a 100% of your payment will be
                refunded
                (transaction charges will be deducted). You may ask for a refund if you are not a 100% satisfied with
                your
                purchase. In such scenarios, we will refund all the balance payment of your order. The amount for which
                we
                have already completed the work for on your project will not be refunded. Please note that only the
                balance payment will be refunded. However, if you have a specific complaint and need a complete refund,
                you may send us a refund request and we will take a fair decision accordingly.</p>

              <h3 class="policy-heading">Indemnification</h3>

              <p>By agreeing to the terms of this agreement, users of the site and service agree to indemnify, defend
                and
                hold harmless ContentDevelopmentPros from and against any and all claim, loss, expense or demand of
                liability, including attorneys' fees and costs incurred by ContentDevelopmentPros and Affiliates in
                connection with any claim by a third party (including an intellectual property claim) arising out of (i)
                materials and content you submit, post or transmit, or (ii) use of the site by you in violation of these
                Terms of Use or in violation of any applicable law.</p>

              <h3 class="policy-heading">Unlimited Revisions Policy</h3>

              <p>We offer unlimited revisions on all projects until they have been completed. Once a project has been
                completed, clients may request revisions for an additional period of 2 weeks (14 days). Clients will
                have
                to start a new project to request further amendments or suggestions. Please note that revisions do not
                include change of project brief. If revision request requires more work that we agreed to at start of
                project or if the request contradicts what was originally discussed, then we may require additional
                payment to accommodate revision.</p>

              <h3 class="policy-heading">Contacting Us</h3>
